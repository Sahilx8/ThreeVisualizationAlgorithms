# Three Algorithm Visualization

This project is a Streamlit-based interactive application that allows users to visualize and compare the results of three popular machine learning algorithms:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

The application provides an intuitive way to explore these algorithms using the **Credit Card Customer Data** dataset.

## Features

- **Linear Regression**: Visualizes a regression line fitting the data and displays the Mean Squared Error (MSE) to assess model performance.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: Implements the KNN algorithm and allows the user to adjust the number of neighbors, providing accuracy as a performance metric.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: Implements the SVM classification model with multiple kernel and hyperparameter options. It outputs the model's accuracy.

## Requirements

To run the application, you need to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Streamlit
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install streamlit numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
